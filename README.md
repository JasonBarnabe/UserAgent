User Agent
=========

User Agent is a Vanilla Forums plug-in. User Agent shows what browser people are posting with. For common browsers, it will show that browser's icon; for uncommon, it will show that browser's name. Hover the name/logo for a tooltip that indicates full User Agent string.

User Agent will only record data while it's enabled, so anything posted before you install it will not show the browser data.


Requirements
=========

* Vanilla 2.5 or higher
* [browscap](http://browscap.org/)


Troubleshooting
=========

* Nothing is displayed? User Agent will only record user agents while it is enabled. It will not display user agents for things posted when it was disabled.
* Only shows `[?]`? Make sure browscap is installed.
* Misidentified browser? User Agent relies purely on browscap for identification. Ensure you have the latest version of browscap. If it's still not propely identified, file an issue with browscap.
* Icon not displayed for certain browsers? User Agent only includes icons for some common browsers. If you'd like more icons, create an issue with the browser name User Agent uses and an icon you'd like it to use.


Donations

If you like User Agent, consider making a donation. Suggested amount is $5.
